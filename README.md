Chess program architecture

main():
	runs the whole game. This includes:
	- init and print a 8x8 chessboard in ASCII. Create a matrix (vector of vectors) for it.
	- Create pieces, one queen and one pawn, for the board, through Piece class and init_pieces()
	- allow user to move the pieces any way it wants to
	- if user tries to move a piece on another piece, it won't allow it
	- quit when user inserts "0"

init_pieces():
	Initiates and returns a vector of all pieces in the game. Currently creates one queen and one pawn.

Piece class:
	- constructor creates a Piece object with string name, int id and int placement.
	- move(new_placement) updates an object's placement
	-
